# Image-manipulation
image manipulation using OpenCV in computer vision

I recently completed a project that involved converting images from the default OpenCV BGR color model to RGB for accurate visual representation, using Matplotlib for display. By leveraging OpenCV's color conversion functions, I effectively reversed the color channels, ensuring the images retained their true colors when displayed outside of OpenCV. This project demonstrated precise control over image manipulation and visualization, essential for applications in computer vision, image processing, and digital media.
